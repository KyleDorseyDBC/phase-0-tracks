Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
Data structures allow programmers to store data, access data, and manipulate the data systematically.

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
An array is a list of stored data with each item in the array set to a specific index.  There can be different data types in an array.

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
First - A list of kids in a class
Second - A list of items you need to pack before you go on a trip

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
A hash stores data in key and value pairs.

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
First - Names and addresses of people in a given neighborhood
Second - user names and user passwords

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
Iteration allows the programmer to go through each item in the array or hash and use the info in the data structure to modify the data or retrieve the data.

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
If you had an age counter for the family.  Every year you would want to increment the age of every member in the family.

Blocks
8. What is a block?
A block is a chunk of code that performs a function on a parameter or two.

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
A block parameter comes from an array or a hash and is the piece of data that the block does work on.
