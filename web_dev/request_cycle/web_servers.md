* One of the most important design philosophies of linux is that it is open source, and free.  This allows it to be broadly used.  Because it is open source, many people have been able to look into just how it works and collaboratively improve it to make it better for everyone. There are a variety of specialty tailored versions of linux made for all sorts of applications. 

* A VPS is a server that uses a portion of a server or computers hardware and then acts as if its it's own computer.  This is done often for security reasons, allowing any attack to only happen to the separate VPS and opposed to the entire system.  This can also allow your to use the rest of your hardware as normal while at the same time handling server hosting.  

* Typical practice dictates that you should run programs without admin privileges this protects the overall system.  Essentially using the root user removes a layer of protection against user error and security threats. 

## Release 2

* onkeydown: null.  I believe this could change the appearance of the button.  So for example when it is clicked on it then changes colors to visually represent that the button has been selected.

* x: and y: I believe this DOM would allow for the relocation of the item on the x and y axis within the page.

* size: This could be interesting, as the size of the button could change depending on the button press.


* onscroll: I am curious as to what this might be useful for. Maybe preventing an item from scrolling off the viewable page if selected, in the case of a header or menu you want to persist.

* onmouseover: When the mouse was hovering over the button it would be able to react a certain way, that could be useful visually aiding the user.
