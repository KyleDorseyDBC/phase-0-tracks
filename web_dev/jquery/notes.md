## Release 0
* I plan on doing a bit of googling to find some jquery references that also includes examples, bookmarking the ones that seem to be most helpful. 

* When a topic is interesting, confusing, or I am unsure how it may operate I will test on my own.

* Ill probably take a break to stretch and grab some more coffee

* Take notes on important things that I find useful that I may want to reference later.

* I want to first learn about why its used and what is the best use case.  Then some basics of how it operates and the syntax.  Next I would like to continue to learn more specific uses of jquery.  Lastly I would like to see how it ties into other programming languages I have learned up to this point and experiment.


## Release 1


* I found that taking a bit of time to find why jquery exists and what basic uses it helps preform gave me a great framework.  When I was confused or found a new topic of interest I practiced it.  One thing I hadn't planned on that I found very useful  was finding a quick tutorial on jquery to get me up and running with the basics then expand beyond that.
